- Asynchronous / Non-blocking
- Single threaded
- light-weight
- OOPS Support
- Imperative / Declarative / Reactive programming

- Prototypical inheritance
- Event Driven
- Compiled (Abstract Syntax Tree) and interpreted both

- ECMA Community - ECMA Specifications
- caniuse.com
- polyfills : to support the older browser
- modernizr : to detect the features

Node Runtime Environment - libvu library - C++ Thread pool

# Async Operations

- Callbacks
- Promises
- Timers : 1250
- XHR : 1200

# ES6 Features

- Arrow Function
- Rest / Spread
- Destructuring
- Sync / Async Code

- Promises
  > Life Cycle State -> Pending -> Settled : Fulfilled, Rejected
  > then().catch()
  > Async...await

# TypeScript : JavaScript with type Syntax

# DataTypes :

- unknown
- tuple
- never
- union

# Creating vite project

> npm create vite@latest > vanilla > typeScript
> cd 02-ts-demo
> npm install

# TypeScript Advantages

- Early errors
- Better Intellisense
- Future JS features support
- Safety
